### Project Roadmap: Weather Motion

**Current State:**
The project currently provides a basic web interface to display sunny, rainy, snowy, and cloudy weather animations using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All `px` units have been converted to `rem` for better responsiveness.

**Overall Goal:**
To create a visually appealing and interactive web application that accurately simulates various weather conditions with realistic animations and potential real-time data integration.

#### Current MVP: Realistic Rain Animation

*   **Objective:** Implement a significantly more realistic rain animation, focusing on varying drop sizes, speeds, and subtle splash effects.
*   **Validation:** Ensure smooth performance and seamless integration with the existing interface.

#### Phase 1: Animation Enhancement & Refinement (Short-term)

*   **Objective:** Significantly improve the realism and visual quality of existing weather animations.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Realistic Rain:** Enhance rain animation with varying drop sizes, speeds, and subtle splash effects.
    *   **Realistic Snow:** Improve snow animation with more natural snowflake shapes, varying fall speeds, and accumulation effects (if feasible with CSS).
    *   **Dynamic Clouds:** Refine cloud movement and appearance for more natural transitions and density variations.
    *   **Sun/Moon Cycle:** Implement a basic day/night cycle with corresponding sun/moon animations.
    *   **Subtle Wind Effects:** Add subtle wind effects to influence rain, snow, and cloud movement.
    *   **Sound Effects:** Integrate subtle ambient sound effects for each weather type (e.g., gentle rain, soft wind, distant thunder).

#### Phase 2: New Weather Types & UI Improvements (Mid-term)

*   **Objective:** Expand the range of weather conditions and enhance the user interface for better interaction.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **New Weather Types:**
        *   Thunderstorm (with lightning and heavier rain/wind).
        *   Foggy (with reduced visibility and atmospheric effects).
        *   Windy (with visual indicators of strong wind).
    *   **Improved UI Controls:** Design a more intuitive and visually appealing control panel for switching weather types.
    *   **Basic Weather Display:** Add a section to display basic weather information (e.g., "Sunny", "Rainy") corresponding to the active animation.

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features & Refactoring (Long-term)

*   **Objective:** Integrate with external data, allow user customization, and ensure code maintainability and scalability.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Real-time Weather API Integration:** Fetch actual weather data (e.g., from OpenWeatherMap) based on user location to dynamically display current weather.
    *   **User Customization:** Allow users to customize animation parameters (e.g., rain intensity, snow density, cloud speed).
    *   **Performance Optimization:** Profile and optimize CSS animations and JavaScript for smoother performance across various devices.
    *   **Code Refactoring:** Refactor CSS (e.g., using CSS variables for themes, BEM methodology) and JavaScript (e.g., modular design, better state management).
    *   **Accessibility Improvements:** Ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities.
    *   **Unit/Integration Tests:** Implement automated tests for JavaScript logic and UI components.
