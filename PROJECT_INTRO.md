### Project Introduction: Weather Motion

**Project Name:** Weather Motion

**Purpose:**
"Weather Motion" is a web-based application designed to visually simulate various weather conditions through dynamic animations. The primary goal is to provide an interactive and aesthetically pleasing representation of different atmospheric phenomena directly in the browser.

**Current Features:**
*   **Weather Simulations:** Displays animated effects for:
    *   Sunny weather (with a rotating sun).
    *   Rainy weather (with realistic, dynamically generated raindrops).
    *   Snowy weather (with falling snowflakes).
    *   Cloudy weather (with moving cloud formations).
*   **Interactive Controls:** Users can switch between different weather types using dedicated buttons.
*   **Responsive Design:** All CSS units are based on `rem` for better scalability and responsiveness across various screen sizes.
*   **Version Control:** Project development is managed using Git, with changes tracked and pushed to a GitHub repository.

**Technologies Used:**
*   **HTML5:** For structuring the web content.
*   **CSS3:** For styling and creating the weather animations (using `@keyframes` and `box-shadow`).
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For interactive elements, dynamic content generation (e.g., raindrops), and controlling weather states.

**Future Outlook (based on Roadmap):**
The project aims to enhance animation realism, introduce more weather types (e.g., thunderstorm, foggy), improve UI/UX, and potentially integrate with real-time weather APIs for dynamic data display.
